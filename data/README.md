# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories. The lyrics.csv file is a filtered corpus of 100,000+ song lyrics from MetroLyrics.  The artists.csv provides additional background information of all the artistis.
